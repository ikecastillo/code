Story Points exist merely as a way to estimate a task's difficulty compared to some other task (for example, a 10-point story would probably take double the effort of a 5-point story). As teams mature with Scrum they tend to achieve a consistent number of Story Points from Sprint to Sprint -- this is termed the team's _velocity_. This allows the Product Owner to use the velocity to predict how many Sprints it will take to deliver parts of the backlog. \n\nMany teams use Planning Poker to achieve consensus on Story Point estimates.\n\n*Using Other Estimation Units*\n\nYou can configure GreenHopper to use time-based estimates if you wish. In the configuration for the board, on the \"Estimation\" tab, select \"Original Time Estimate\" as your Estimation Statistic. If you also wish to track the time used during the Sprint, select \"Remaining Estimate and Time Spent\" to enable Time Tracking in GreenHopper.","priority":{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/priority/2","iconUrl":"http://localhost:2990/jira/images/icons/priorities/critical.png","name":"Critical","id":"2"},"duedate":null,"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":5.0,"customfield_10003":null,"issuelinks":[],"customfield_10004":"4","watches":{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/issue/KPIP-4/watchers","watchCount":0,"isWatching":false},"customfield_10000":null,"subtasks":[],"status":{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/status/10000","description":"","iconUrl":"http://localhost:2990/jira/images/icons/subtask.gif","name":"To Do","id":"10000"},"customfield_10006":null,"labels":[],"customfield_10005":null,"workratio":-1,"assignee":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"project":{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/project/KPIP","id":"10100","key":"KPIP","name":"kpipoc","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"http://localhost:2990/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=10100&avatarId=10011","48x48":"http://localhost:2990/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=10100&avatarId=10011"}},"versions":[],"environment":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"lastViewed":null,"components":[],"customfield_10010":null,"timeoriginalestimate":null,"aggregatetimespent":null}},{"expand":"editmeta,renderedFields,transitions,changelog,operations","id":"10102","self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/issue/10102","key":"KPIP-3","fields":{"summary":"As a product owner, I'd like to rank stories in the backlog so I can communicate the proposed implementation order >> Try dragging this story up above the previous story","progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"issuetype":{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/6","id":"6","description":"Story","iconUrl":"http://localhost:2990/jira/images/icons/genericissue.gif","name":"Story","subtask":false},"votes":{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/issue/KPIP-3/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"resolution":null,"fixVersions":[{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/version/10005","id":"10005","name":"Version 3.0","archived":false,"released":false}],"resolutiondate":null,"timespent":null,"reporter":{"self":"http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=admin","name":"admin","emailAddress":"admin@example.com","avatarUrls":{"16x16":"http://localhost:2990/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122","48x48":"http://localhost:2990/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122"},"displayName":"admin","active":true},"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"created":"2013-05-04T22:28:23.000-0400","updated":"2013-05-04T22:28:23.000-0400","description":"*About the Product Backlog*\n\nThe backlog is the source of truth for the order of work to be completed.
